#Comments in python - "#" single line comment
string = '''
This is a multline comment in Python. 
It's actually a multiline string which can be used like a comment. 
You can also print this multiline string to make sure that it's string.

And the content of string looks like it is in <pre></pre> tag of HTML

a = 10 
print(a)

TAB works too.

Example -                               "8 * TAB"

This code is not working.

Type of this multiple string can be checked by print(type(string)) - '''

b = type(string)
print(string + str(b))
